how you fought your way out of their words

how you taught your eyes to look away

how you held the light in your mouth

how you chose to grow kindness

instead

all the courage that lives in your hands, all the fear

that you stand on every day

you are a tree called beauty, strong

you are branches

flung wide open, filled

with song
